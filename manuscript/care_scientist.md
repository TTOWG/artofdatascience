# The Care and Feeding of Your Scientist Collaborator

We (Elizabeth and Roger) have been working together for a decade now and the story of how we started working together is perhaps a brief lesson on collaboration in and of itself. Basically, Elizabeth emailed someone who didn’t have time, so that person emailed someone else who didn’t have time, so that person emailed someone else who didn’t have time, so that person emailed Roger, who as a mere assistant professor had plenty of time! Some people are irked by this process because it feels like you’re someone’s fourth choice. But many good collaborations come about this way it either works or it doesn’t work, regardless of where on the list you were when you were contacted.

Once you’ve found yourself a collaborator, either in the scientific or business domain, what should you do with this person? Here is some advice that we have accumulated over the 

## A Scientist is Not a Fountain From Which “The Numbers” Flow

Most statisticians like to work with data, and some even need it to demonstrate the usefulness of their methods or theory. So there’s a temptation to go “find a scientist” to give you some data”. This is starting off on the wrong foot. If you picture your collaborator as a person who hands over the data and then you never talk to that person again, then things will probably not end up so great. 

There are two ways in which the experience will be sub-optimal. First, your scientist collaborator may feel miffed that you basically went off and did your own thing, making them less inclined to work with you in the future. Second, the product you end up with (paper, software, algorithm, etc.) might not have the same impact on science as it would have had if you’d worked together more closely. This is the bigger problem: see #5 below.
  
## Be Patient, Not Patronizing

Statisticians are often annoyed that “So-and-so didn’t even know this” or “they tried to do this with a sample size of 3!” True, there are egregious cases of scientists with a lack of basic statistical knowledge, but *all good collaborations involve some teaching*. Otherwise, why would you collaborate with someone who knows exactly the same things that you know? 

Just like it’s important to take some time to learn the discipline that you are applying your statistical methods to, it’s important to take some time to describe to your collaborator how those statistical methods you’re using really work. Where does the information in the data come from? What aspects are important; what aspects are not important? What do parameter estimates mean in the context of this problem? If you find you can’t actually explain these concepts, or become very impatient when they don’t understand, that may be an indication that there’s a problem with the method itself that may need rethinking. Or maybe you just need a simpler method.


## Go To Where They Are

This bit of advice Roger got from when he was just starting out at Johns Hopkins as a lowly assistant professor. The bottom line is that if you understand where the data come from (as in literally, the data come from this organ in this person’s body), then you might not be so flippant about asking for an extra 100 subjects to have a sufficient sample size. 

In biomedical science, the data usually come from people. Real people. And the job of collecting that data, the scientist’s job, is usually not easy. So if you have a chance, go see how the data are collected and what needs to be done. Even just going to their office or lab for a meeting rather than having them come to you can be helpful in understanding the environment and context in which they work. 

It can feel nice (and convenient) to have everyone coming to you, but that’s just vanity. Take the time and go to where they are.


## Their Business Is Your Business, So Pitch In

A lot of research (and actually most jobs) involves doing things that are not specifically relevant to your primary goal (a paper in a good journal). But sometimes you do those things to achieve broader goals, like building better relationships and networks of contacts. This may involve, say, doing a sample size calculation once in a while for a new grant that’s going in. That may not be pertinent to your current project, but it’s not that hard to do, and it’ll help your collaborator a lot. You’re part of a team here, so everyone has to pitch in. In a restaurant kitchen, even the Chef works the line once in a while. Another way to think of this is as an investment. Particularly in the early stages there’s going to be a lot of ambiguity about what should be done and what is the best way to proceed. Sometimes the ideal solution won’t show itself until much later (the so-called “j-shaped curve” of investment). In the meantime, pitch in and keep things 

## Your Job Is To Advance The Science

In a good collaboration, everyone should be focused on the same goal. In my area, that goal is improving public health. If I have to prove a theorem or develop a new method to do that, then I will (or at least try). But if I’m collaborating with a biomedical scientist, there has to be an alignment of long-term goals. Otherwise, if the goals are scattered, the science tends to be scattered, and ultimately sub-optimal with respect to impact. I actually think that if you think of your job in this way (to advance the science), then you end up with better collaborations. Why? Because you start looking for people who are similarly advancing the science and having an impact, rather than looking for people who have “good data”, whatever that means, for applying your methods.

In the end, I think statisticians need to focus on two things: Go out and find the best people to work with and then help them advance the science.
